# Narrative Consistency & Fact Validation System

## Team Name
ECO GENESIS

## Problem Statement
To analyze a given textual narrative and determine:
- Logical consistency
- Factual correctness
- Presence of future or predictive statements
- Confidence-based verdicts

---

## Our Solution Overview
We propose a **Multi-Agent Narrative Analysis System** that evaluates text using structured reasoning instead of simple keyword matching.

The system is designed to:
- Detect internal contradictions
- Identify factually incorrect claims
- Separate future predictions from verifiable facts
- Provide explainable, confidence-based results

## Key Features
- **Explainable AI**: Every verdict includes reasoning and confidence
- **Multi-Agent Design**: Independent agents analyze different aspects of text
- **Future-Aware**: Predictive statements are handled separately
- **Modular & Scalable**: Easily extendable with external knowledge sources

---

## Example Use Cases
- Detecting contradictory news articles
- Fact-checking short statements
- Separating opinions and predictions from facts
- Narrative consistency evaluation in documents

---

## Limitations
- Absolute truth and future certainty cannot be guaranteed
- Outputs are probabilistic and confidence-based
- Designed for short to medium-length narratives

---

## Conclusion
Our system provides a practical, explainable, and scalable approach to narrative consistency and fact validation, suitable for real-world analytical applications.
